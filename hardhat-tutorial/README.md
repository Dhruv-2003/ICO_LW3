# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

Crypto Devs Token Contract Address: 0xcfC67C22D7157b88FB47777ba0b95E587c3d90820xcfC67C22D7157b88FB47777ba0b95E587c3d9082

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
